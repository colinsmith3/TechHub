## Project Details

TechHub is a tech blog website. It uses three post types: `blogs`, `categories`, and `authors`, and relations between these three post type, so that we can create a blog post with a category and an author. Also we will make a `search feature` where we can search against all these three post types.

To create this website we will use `JAMstack`. We will use `Gatsby.js` for the frontend and `Sanity.io` for the headless CMS. And to source our content we will use `graphql`.
